Change History
==============
Version 0.02 (01/2015)
-> Allow actions and guards via user-definable interfaces.
-> Allow different instances of user-defined interface per StateMachineInstance
-> Improved unit-tests

Version 0.01 (11/2014)
-> Initial version
-> StateMachine for creation and storage of state machine prototypes
-> StateMachineInstance for storing and interacting with instances of state machines
-> States with no hirachies but with entry and exit actions
-> Transitions between states triggered by events, protected by simple guards and triggering simple actions (both std::function based)


Planned features
================
-> Hirachy of states: Sub-States and Super-States
-> Decision-States with conditional statements and auto-transitions based on result of condition
-> Sub-State history
-> Clean up library interface. StateMachine.h still publishes to many internals.
